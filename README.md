Awesome, Shadab — let's roll. Here's a 🔥 **professional `README.md`** for your full-stack DevOps monitoring project using Flask, Docker, Prometheus, and Grafana:

---

```markdown
# 📦 Full DevOps Monitoring Project — Flask + Docker + Prometheus + Grafana

> 🔥 A real-world DevOps project to showcase infrastructure monitoring and container orchestration using industry-standard tools.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full DevOps workflow:
- A simple **Flask web application** exposing custom metrics.
- Containerized with **Docker**.
- Monitored by **Prometheus**.
- Visualized in **Grafana**.

It’s designed to simulate real-world monitoring setups used in production environments.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 📌 1. Flask App

Exposes:
- `/` - Basic route
- `/metrics` - Prometheus-readable metrics endpoint

```python
REQUEST_COUNT = Counter('app_requests_total', 'Total number of HTTP requests')
````

---

### 📌 2. Prometheus

Configured to scrape metrics from the Flask app:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'flask-app'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['flask-app:5000']
```

---

### 📌 3. Grafana

* Login: `admin` / `admin`
* Access at: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
* Add Prometheus as a data source
* Create dashboards using metrics like `app_requests_total`

---

## 🐳 Run It with Docker

```bash
# Build and run the full stack
docker-compose up --build
```

Access:

* Flask App: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
* Prometheus: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
* Grafana: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
